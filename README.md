<h3>Django Test Instruction</h3>

Hi there! You are going to make edits on a Django project. The Django project is a super simple version of Reddit. Note that the repo uses terminology that differs from Reddit terminology. Clone this repo (https://github.com/nikolak/django_reddit) and complete the following tasks:

1. Make it work.
   There are a couple bugs in the repo. Depending on your version, bugs are very likely to occur. We expect you to fix these bugs and make the original code run.
   <u> Deliverables:</u> Make a post with your full name and the date (Jul 04, 2023) or (MMM DD, YYYY) format and send over the screenshot.

2. For submissions that have URL, the code will automatically direct you to the URL rather than the submissions detail page. We are going to change it. When a user clicks on the submission/post from the home page, it will direct them to the detailed submission page (please find the right views.py function). If a submission has a URL, we will just display the URL as an additional line instead.
   <u> Deliverables:</u> You are going to make two posts, one with a URL and the other one without URL and send over the screenshot.

3. Let's add some additional information: submissions and comments on the user profile.
   <u> Deliverables:</u>: Make a couple of posts after registering yourself and take a screenshot of your profile with the list of comments and submissions.

4. Let's add an "Edit" button on the comment page that allows the right user to edit his own submissions.
   <u> Deliverables: </u>: Take two screenshots of the new comments page with the functioning "edit" bottom. First screenshot shows the submission and the second screenshot shows the SAME submission (with the same ID) but with edited content.

   Before:

   After:

5. Finally, please upload a youtube or loom video going over a live demo with the above tasks.

<h3> Exam Test Repository </h3>
<h3> Description </h3>
This repository contains my work for the exam test. I have completed 4 out of 5 tests and had a great time working on them. The tasks I performed included data manipulation/visualization, LangChain, Discord API, and creating a Discord Chatbot using LangChain.

<h3> Test Details </h3>
1. Data Manipulation/Visualization: I worked on manipulating and visualizing data using various Python libraries, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The code for this task can be found in the data_manipulation folder.

2. LangChain: I utilized the LangChain library to perform language processing tasks. This involved tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. The code for this task can be found in the langchain_tasks folder.

3. Discord API: I integrated the Discord API into my project to interact with Discord servers and users. This allowed me to retrieve information, send messages, and perform various actions on Discord. The code for this task can be found in the discord_api_integration folder.

4. Discord Chatbot using LangChain: I built a chatbot for Discord using the LangChain library. This involved training a language model, implementing conversational logic, and integrating it with the Discord API. The code for this task can be found in the discord_chatbot folder.

<h3> Code </h3>
I have developed the code for this project using Google Colab, a cloud-based development environment. You can find the Jupyter notebooks containing the code in the code folder.

<h3> Pending Task </h3>
Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the Django part of the exam. Due to time constraints and other commitments, I couldn't devote sufficient time to work on this particular task. However, I plan to continue working on it in the future to enhance my skills in web development using Django.

<h3> Feedback </h3>
Please feel free to review my code and provide any feedback or suggestions you may have. I appreciate your time and input.

<h3> Contact </h3>
